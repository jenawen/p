              For the past two years, Iâ€™ve created streamlined user interfaces
              for the credit card and financial industry. I'm passionate about
              web design and development and excel at implementing intended
              designs into functional, scalable components. I love collaborating
              with others, and strive to make the design-to-development process
              as productive as possible.{" "}

              Outside of web development, I have an interest in data analysis
              and have experience creating data reports and dashboards. I enjoy
              taking high-volume datasets and creating dynamic ways to visualize
              and interact with them, just like with websites and applications.
